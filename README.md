# Resources for Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop

This repository provides a collection of resources to support the study of *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by Christopher M. Bishop.

## 1. Slides, Solutions, and Notes

* The author himself has shared slides for Chapters [1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/prml-slides-1.pdf), [2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/prml-slides-2.pdf), [3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/prml-slides-3.pdf) & [8](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/prml-slides-8.pdf), as well as [many solutions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/prml-web-sol-2009-09-08.pdf).

* The INRIA reading group has created comprehensive slides covering every chapter of the book. Access their slides [here](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/~jegou/bishopreadinggroup/). If the link doesn't work, use this [alternative link](https://www.changjiangcai.com/studynotes/2020-12-09-PRML-Bishop/).

* João Pedro Neto has posted helpful notes and implementations in R. Check them out [here](https://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/r/). (Scroll down to where it says "PRML")

* Seoul National University offers detailed PowerPoint slides summarizing Chapter 1, including polynomial curve fitting, Bayesian probabilities, and model selection. Available [here](https://www.slideserve.com/yvonneh/ch-1-introduction-pattern-recognition-and-machine-learning-c-m-bishop-2006-powerpoint-ppt-presentation).

## 2. Recommended Courses

* [Tom Mitchell: Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10701_sp11/lectures.shtml)

* [Pattern Recognition: Indian Institute of Science](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbMVogVj5nJSlpmy0ni_5-RgbseafOViy) (Focuses only on Supervised Learning and follows Bishop's approach)

## 3. Related Courses with Lecture Videos

* A course that closely follows parts of Bishop's book is available at this [link](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/STA4273_2015/). It includes lecture videos that enhance understanding of the material.

* [Christopher Bishop: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o17htMVZ9g) - A video lecture by Christopher Bishop himself, introducing core ideas from PRML. Ideal for understanding the author's perspective and foundational concepts.

* YouTube playlists by Sina Tootoonian covering specific chapters: [Chapter 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMBgIqOUbrlvf4osKxJyZ7kMbSuIPEyO), [Chapter 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMBgIqOUbrlUr6VwLvoib7avlh8EFkhS), [Chapter 3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMBgIqOUbrnGulJZarEgvbywR5X20Grq), [Chapter 12](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWMBgIqOUbrkUx0GRNtfTJn8Z_IcUMQyl). Additional chapters may also be available, check the channel for the latest updates.



## 4. Jupyter Notebooks with Python Implementations

* For hands-on learners, explore this collection of Jupyter notebooks with Python implementations and scikit-learn usage for PRML. Access the notebooks [here](https://github.com/amber-kshz/PRML).

* Another valuable resource is this GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/ctgk/PRML), which contains Python code implementations of the algorithms described in Bishop's book.

## 5. Blog Posts

* [Bishop's PRML book: Review and Insights, Chapters 1–3](https://medium.com/techburst/bishops-prml-book-review-and-insights-chapters-1-3-528bb5cfaade)

* [Bishop's PRML book: Review and Insights, Chapters 4–6](https://medium.com/data-science/bishops-prml-book-review-and-insights-chapters-4-6-eb2a2a33c939)

## 6. Recommended Book on Information Theory

An often overlooked book that aligns well with the framework of PRML is [Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms by David MacKay](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf). It offers a similar perspective and can be highly enlightening, especially if you enjoy concepts like information theory, coding, and KL-divergence.

## 7. Textbook Availability

The textbook "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Chris Bishop can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf).
